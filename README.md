# Weather-Monitoring-System-IoT-
This project monitors weather conditions using NodeMCU, DHT11, and MQ135 sensors to detect temperature, humidity, and air quality. Data is displayed on an LCD and sent to the BLYNK app. The system helps monitor environmental conditions remotely for better decision-making in agriculture, industries, and other areas.
